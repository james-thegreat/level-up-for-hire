### `1-two-sum/test-cases.txt`

This file is a simple list of test cases, each on a new line. You can manually copy and paste these into your LeetCode solution or use a script to run them locally. For this simple problem, a plain text file is sufficient.

```text
# Example 1: Basic case
nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Expected = [0,1]

# Example 2: Negative numbers
nums = [3,-1,5,10], target = 2
Expected = [1,3]

# Example 3: Different order
nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Expected = [1,2]

# Example 4: Edge case (smallest array)
nums = [3,3], target = 6
Expected = [0,1]
